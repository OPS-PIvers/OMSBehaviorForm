# FERPA Compliance Guide

This document outlines how the Student Behavior Management System addresses the requirements of the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA).

## Key FERPA Principles Addressed:

1.  **Student Data Classification**:
    *   The system identifies and protects educational records as defined by FERPA.
    *   `FERPACompliance.EDUCATIONAL_RECORD_TYPES` in `compliance/ferpa-compliance.gs` lists recognized types.

2.  **Access Controls**:
    *   Access to student data is strictly limited to authorized personnel with a legitimate educational interest.
    *   `FERPACompliance.validateEducationalInterest()` in `compliance/ferpa-compliance.gs` enforces this.
    *   Role-based access controls will be further defined in `permissions/role-management.gs`.

3.  **Consent Management**:
    *   The system includes mechanisms for obtaining and managing parent/student consent for data sharing where required.
    *   `ConsentManager` class in `privacy/consent-management.gs` handles consent recording and withdrawal.
    *   `FERPACompliance.verifyConsent()` in `compliance/ferpa-compliance.gs` checks for valid consent.

4.  **Data Minimization**:
    *   The system is designed to collect only the information necessary for its stated educational purposes.
    *   `FERPACompliance.minimizeDataCollection()` in `compliance/ferpa-compliance.gs` helps ensure only required fields are processed.

5.  **Breach Response**:
    *   Procedures are in place for responding to data security incidents involving student data.
    *   `FERPACompliance.handleDataBreach()` in `compliance/ferpa-compliance.gs` outlines the steps for containment, notification, and documentation.

6.  **Right to Inspect and Review**:
    *   Parents and eligible students have the right to inspect and review education records.
    *   `ConsentManager.generateDataSubjectReport()` in `privacy/consent-management.gs` facilitates this.

7.  **Right to Amend Records**:
    *   Procedures for requesting amendments to records that are inaccurate or misleading will be established. (Details to be added)

8.  **Disclosure Limitations**:
    *   The system will control and log disclosures of personally identifiable information (PII) from education records. (Details to be added, linking to Audit Logger)

## Responsibilities:

*   **School Administrators**: Ensure policies are followed, staff are trained, and access rights are correctly assigned.
*   **Teachers & Staff**: Understand and adhere to FERPA guidelines when accessing or inputting student data.
*   **System Developers**: Maintain and update the system to comply with FERPA regulations.
