6.  **Select Character Pillar:**
    *   Choose the character pillar that best aligns with the observed behavior (e.g., "Respect," "Responsibility").
    *   See [Selecting Appropriate Character Pillars](#selecting-appropriate-character-pillars).
    *   *(Placeholder: Screenshot of character pillar dropdown - `images/form_screenshots/07_pillar_dropdown.png`)*
7.  **Select Specific Behavior:**
    *   Based on the chosen pillar, a list of specific behaviors will appear. Select the one that most accurately describes what you observed.
    *   See [Choosing Specific Behaviors](#choosing-specific-behaviors).
    *   *(Placeholder: Screenshot of specific behavior dropdown - `images/form_screenshots/08_behavior_dropdown.png`)*
8.  **Write Effective Comments:**
    *   Provide objective, factual details about the incident. See [Writing Effective Comments](#writing-effective-comments).
    *   *(Placeholder: Screenshot of comments text area - `images/form_screenshots/09_comments_field.png`)*

    *   *(Placeholder: Screenshot of submission confirmation message - `images/form_screenshots/10_submission_confirmation.png`)*

### Student Lookup Functionality
The form should allow you to easily find students. Common methods:
*   **Type to Search:** Start typing the student's Last Name, First Name, or Student ID in the designated field. A dropdown list of matching students should appear.
*   **Dropdown List:** Some forms might present a full dropdown list of students (less common for large schools).
*   **Tips for Lookup:**
    *   If unsure of spelling, try typing a partial name.
    *   If a student doesn't appear, double-check the spelling. If still not found, notify your administrator as the student might not be in the system directory or there might be a data entry error.

### Selecting Appropriate Character Pillars
Your school will have a defined set of character pillars. These are the broad categories for behavior.
*   **Familiarize Yourself:** Understand your school's specific pillars and what they represent.
*   **Primary Focus:** Choose the pillar that is most directly related to the behavior you observed.
*   **Example:** If a student helped a classmate without being asked, "Kindness" or "Responsibility" might be appropriate, depending on your school's definitions.

### Choosing Specific Behaviors
Once a pillar is selected, the form will show related specific, observable behaviors.
*   **Observable Actions:** Select the behavior that best describes what you actually saw or heard.
*   **Avoid Generalities:** Instead of "was disruptive," if the specific behavior "Called out without permission" is an option under "Respect," choose that.
*   **If No Exact Match:** Choose the closest available behavior and provide further clarification in the comments section.

### Writing Effective Comments
Comments provide essential context. Aim for comments that are:
*   **Objective & Factual:** Describe what happened, not your interpretation or emotions.
    *   *Instead of:* "Sarah was rude."
    *   *Consider:* "During group work, Sarah told another student their idea was 'stupid'."
*   **Specific:** Include details like when, where, and what specifically occurred.
    *   *Instead of:* "John was helpful."
    *   *Consider:* "In math class today, John noticed Michael struggling with a problem and patiently explained the steps to him."
*   **Brief & To the Point:** Be concise while providing necessary information.
*   **Behavior-Focused (for Stop & Think):** Describe the behavior, not the child's character.
    *   *Instead of:* "David is a lazy student."
    *   *Consider:* "David did not turn in his homework assignment for the third time this week."
*   **Action-Oriented (Optional, for Stop & Think):** Briefly note any immediate actions taken.
    *   *Example:* "...I spoke with David after class about the importance of completing assignments."

## 3. Good News vs. Stop & Think Reports

Understanding when and how to use each report type is key to the system's effectiveness.

### When to Use Each Type

*   **Good News Reports:**
    *   Use to recognize and reinforce positive behaviors that align with your school's character pillars.
    *   When a student goes above and beyond, shows improvement, or consistently demonstrates desired traits.
    *   Helps build a positive school climate and provides positive reinforcement.
*   **Stop & Think Reports:**
    *   Use to document behaviors that are not meeting school expectations or are disruptive to learning.
    *   For incidents that require intervention, communication with parents, or administrative awareness.
    *   Provides data for identifying patterns and planning support for students.

### Best Practices for Positive Recognition (Good News)
*   **Be Specific:** Don't just say "Good job." Mention the specific pillar and behavior.
*   **Be Timely:** Submit Good News reports soon after observing the positive behavior.
*   **Be Genuine:** Students (and parents) can tell when recognition is sincere.
*   **Spread it Around:** Try to recognize a variety of students, not just the same few.
*   **Link to School Values:** Explicitly connect the behavior to one of your school's character pillars. This reinforces their importance.

### Constructive Approach to Improvement Opportunities (Stop & Think)
*   **Focus on Behavior:** Describe the specific, observable behavior, not your judgment of the student's character.
*   **Maintain Objectivity:** Stick to facts. Avoid emotional language.
*   **Identify the Expectation:** Implicitly or explicitly, the report should relate to a school expectation that wasn't met.
*   **For Data & Communication:** Remember these reports are tools for tracking, communication, and planning interventions. They are not solely punitive.
*   **Confidentiality:** Treat all student behavior information with confidentiality, adhering to school and FERPA guidelines.

    *   *"[Student Name] had difficulty with [Pillar] today when they [Specific Behavior]. This occurred when [Context]. We discussed [Briefly mention intervention/conversation, if any]."*

### Troubleshooting Tips
*   **Form Not Loading:**
    *   Check your internet connection.
    *   Try refreshing the page.
    *   Ensure you are logged into your school Google account (if required).
    *   Clear your browser cache/cookies (as a last resort, or ask admin for help).
*   **Student Not Found:**
    *   Double-check spelling of the student's name/ID.
    *   Try searching by only last name or only first name.
    *   If the student is new or you're sure they should be listed, contact your system administrator. The student directory may need updating.
*   **Error Message on Submission:**
    *   Read the error message carefully. It might indicate a required field is missing.
    *   Try submitting again.
    *   If the problem persists, note the error message and contact your administrator.
*   **Dropdowns (Pillars/Behaviors) Empty or Incorrect:**
    *   This usually indicates an issue with the backend configuration. Report this to your administrator.

## 5. Best Practices

### Timing of Behavior Reports
*   **As Soon As Possible:** Submit reports as close to the time of the observed behavior as practical. This ensures accuracy of details.
*   **Balance:** While promptness is good, ensure you can complete the report thoughtfully without disrupting your current duties significantly.
*   **For Minor, Immediate Corrections:** Not every minor redirection needs a formal "Stop & Think" report. Use professional judgment. However, if a behavior is part of a pattern or is significant, document it.

### Collaborative Communication with Parents
*   **System as a Tool:** The email notifications are one part of parent communication.
*   **Personal Follow-Up:** For significant "Stop & Think" incidents, a phone call or personal email to parents can be more effective and allow for dialogue. The system report can serve as documentation for that conversation.
*   **Positive Calls/Emails Too:** Don't let the system be the only way parents hear good news. A positive phone call home can be very powerful.
*   **Consistency:** Ensure your comments in the report align with what you would say to a parent directly.

### Documentation Standards
*   **Professional Language:** Use clear, professional language in all comments. Avoid slang, jargon, or overly casual phrasing.
*   **Objectivity:** As emphasized before, stick to observable facts.
*   **Confidentiality:** Always handle student behavior information with the utmost confidentiality, in line with FERPA and school policies. Do not discuss specific student reports in public areas or with unauthorized individuals.
*   **Purposeful Reporting:** Submit reports with the intent of supporting student growth, improving school climate, and facilitating necessary communication.
